Welcome to my personal repository!

I'm now heading to install High Sierra on my old 2012. This is HackInTosh!!  !!I have working on a iOS Archive team too!!

My Specs (Laptop):
   
   Intel Pentium B960 Sandy Bridge 2.20 GHz No VT-x No Vt-d BIOS has nearly nothing (expect the Graphic Mode) with Intel HD Graphics 2000 128MB VRAM
   RAM 6GB DDR3 4 Slot RAM 1 Slot 2GB 1 Slot 4GB 
   nVIDIA Gefore GT 620M 1GB VRAM
   Wifi Atheros AR5B125 AR9485 
   ACER Aspire E1-531G from 2011 has both UEFI and Legacy support !!gg!!


Hackintosh have to do list (40% Completed):

    ✅ Gathered Files (kext, EFI drivers, ACPI, etc)
    ✅ Set the BIOS (my BIOS has nearly nothing so i can freely Hackintosh without touching BIOS)
    ✅ Install High Sierra 10.13.6 (17G66)
    ✅ Setup High Sierra using Safe Mode to pass the IOConsoleUsers panic
    ✅ Install Atheros Kext using KextUtility to both install & reload kext cache
    ✅ Switch Graphic Mode from Switchable to Intergrated 
    ✅ Finished setup the Hackintosh without the graphics and Audio.
    ✅ Installed nVIDIA Web Driver & CUDA Driver using the Web Driver Patch
    ✅ Switch Graphic Mode on BIOS back to Switchable & Tick NVIDIA WEB in config.plist (with nvda_drv=1 boot-arg)
    ✅ Patched AppleHDA + Installed VoodooHDA (idk if VoodooHDA is necessary)
    ✅ Full setup complete without the 4MB VRAM thing!
        Fix the 4MB VRAM
        Fix the Graphics
        Enable Hardware Acceleration for nVIDIA Web Driver
        Make Audio more better
        Fix slow WiFi issue (11 Mpbs)

        Stable the macOS 
        Install Homebrew (a heap spray)
