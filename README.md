Welcome to my personal repository!

I'm now heading to install High Sierra on my old 2012 Acer Aspire E1-531G with nVIDIA Gefore GT 620M 1GB + Intel Pentium B960 Sandy Bridge 2.20 GHz 128MB.


Hackintosh have to do list (50% Completed):

Completed:

    ✅ Gathered Files (kext, EFI drivers, ACPI, etc)
    ✅ Set the BIOS (my BIOS has nearly nothing so i can freely Hackintosh without touching BIOS)
    ✅ Install High Sierra 10.13.6 (17G66)
    ✅ Setup High Sierra using Safe Mode to pass the IOConsoleUsers panic
    ✅ Install Atheros Kext using KextUtility to both install & reload kext cache
    ✅ Switch Graphic Mode from Switchable to Intergrated 
    ✅ Finished setup the Hackintosh without the graphics and Audio.
    ✅ Installed nVIDIA Web Driver & CUDA Driver using the Web Driver Patch
    ✅ Patched AppleHDA + Installed VoodooHDA (idk if VoodooHDA is necessary)
    ✅ Full setup complete without the 4MB VRAM thing!
